#File Status

# 1 We've updated one file in the repo, and created another file.
# Run the git command that will show you the status of the repo's files.

    git status

# 2 Now run the git command that will show you the changes made within the files.
# (Changes to the tracked file will be shown, but not the untracked file.)

    git log -p

# 3 Stage chapter1.txt.

    git add <chapter1.txt>

# 4 Now stage chapter2.txt.

    git add <chapter2.txt>

# 5 Run the "git diff" command again, but this time add the option that will show you the staged changes. 
# (When you have the command right, changes to both the file that was previously 
# tracked and the file that was previously untracked will be shown.)


    git diff --staged

# 6 Finally, commit all the staged files. Use the -m flag, with any commit message you like.

    git commit -m" review git concepts"
