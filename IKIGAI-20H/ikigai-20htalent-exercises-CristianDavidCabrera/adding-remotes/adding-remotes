# Adding Remotes

# 1 - We've created a local repo to hold our fan fiction, and now we'd like to push it to GitHub.
# We've created a repo on GitHub as well, with the URL https://github.com/treehouse-courses/fan-fiction.git.
#
# GitHub is recommending we run this command to add the remote repo:
#
#Â git remote add origin https://github.com/treehouse-courses/fan-fiction.git

# Run that command now.

    git remote add origin https://github.com/treehouse-courses/fan-fiction.git


# 2 - Next, GitHub recommends that you push your existing commits to the remote repo. They suggest running the command:
#
# git push -u origin master
#
# That will push to the new origin remote from the master branch. 
# The -u option will set up the git push command to push to the given remote from the given branch by default. 
# Run the suggested command now.

    git push -u origin master
