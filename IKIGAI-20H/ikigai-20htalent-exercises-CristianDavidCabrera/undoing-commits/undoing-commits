# Undoing Commits

# 1 - We've decided we need to get back the appendix.txt file that we deleted before. 
# First, we need to find the commit where we removed it. 
# Run the command that will show the log of all prior commits.

    git log

# 2 - Running git log gave the following output:

# commit 70692324faa22f3eaeeb4d80e0958f349f4155bc
# Author: Treehouse Student <me@example.com>
# Date:   Fri Jan 19 13:13:30 2018 -0700

#    Fix file name

# commit 962f0e9138bab1ebb5b3e21d18a747fe18236714
# Author: Treehouse Student <me@example.com>

#    Remove appendix
# ... 

# We want to bring appendix.txt back, which we can do by reverting the commit with the message "Remove appendix". 
# Find the SHA checksum for that commit, and use it in the appropriate command. 
# (This command triggers a new commit, so normally, an editor would pop up to allow you to edit that new commit's message. 
# For this challenge, though, we just want you to run the command.)

    git revert  962f
