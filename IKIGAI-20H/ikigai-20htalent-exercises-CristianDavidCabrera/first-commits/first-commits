#comand line. Change to into directory novel

# 1 We're working on our first novel, and we want to track our changes in Git. 
# But first, we need to change into the directory where our text files are. 
# Using this shell prompt, change into the novel directory.

    cd novel

# 2 Initialize a new Git repo here in the current directory.

    git init

# 3 Add the file chapter1.txt to the staging area for committing.

    touch /novel/chapter1.txt
    git add -A

# 4 Finally, commit the staged file, with a message of "Add chapter 1". 
# Rather than letting Git launch an editor, specify your commit message on the command line: 
# use the -m command line option, and specify your message between "quotation marks".

    git commit -m "Add chapter 1"
