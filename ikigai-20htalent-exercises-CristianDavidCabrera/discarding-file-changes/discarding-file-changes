# Discarding File Changes

# 1 We've unstaged chapter3.txt, but the file is still modified in the working directory. 
# Run "git status" to display its status.

    git status

# 2  Running git status gave the following output:

    # On branch master
    #Â Changes not staged for commit:
    #  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    #  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
    #
    #        modified:   chapter3.txt
    #
    # no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")   

# Let's run the command it suggests to discard the changes to chapter3.txt.

    git checkout -- chapter3.txt
