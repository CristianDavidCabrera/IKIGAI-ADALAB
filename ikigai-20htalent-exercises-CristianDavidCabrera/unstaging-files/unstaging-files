#Unstaging Files

# 1 - We staged a change to a file, but we've decided it wasn't a good idea. 
# Run "git status" to display the staged file names.

    git status

# 2 - Running git status gave the following output:

    # On branch master Changes to be committed:
    #  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
    #
    #        modified:   chapter3.txt
    #
    # Let's run the command it suggests to unstage the file.

    git reset HEAD chapter3.txt
