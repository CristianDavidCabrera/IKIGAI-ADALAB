# Moving Files

# 1 - We accidentally committed a file with the wrong file name extension. 
# Run the git command to move the "chapter3.text" file to the name "chapter3.txt".

        git mv chapter3.text chapter3.txt

# 2 - Run the command to display the status of the repo's files.

        git status

# 3 - Commit the file renaming. Use the -m flag, with any commit message you like.

        git commit -m "modified .text to .txt"
