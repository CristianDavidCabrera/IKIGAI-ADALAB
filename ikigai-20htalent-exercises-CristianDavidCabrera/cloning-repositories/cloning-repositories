# Cloning Repositories

# 1 - Let's try cloning a Git repository. But this time, instead of cloning a local repo, we'll clone one from the Internet.

# Here's a terminal on a different computer. Run the "git clone" command.
# Instead of a local directory name to clone from, give it a URL of "https://github.com/treehouse-courses/novel.git". 
# By default, this will clone to a local directory named novel, but you can specify a different directory name after the URL, if you want.

    git clone https://github.com/treehouse-courses/novel.git
